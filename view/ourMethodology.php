    </h6>
    <br>
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">What is a Key Topic?</h5>
    <h6 class="">
        <p>The topics filtered by our algorithm are referenced as key topics in our interface.</p>

    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">What is a Tagged Topic?</h5>
    <h6 class="">
        <p>These are the words that you, the user, will specifically tell our code to look for in the meetings. Tagging words allows you to analyze sentiment, subjectivity, frequency and a lot more information -- just like the code already does with the words from key topics.</p>

    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">What are Trending Keywords?</h5>
